For Data Scientists

Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.
HackerNews API data source JSON


You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.


Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?
Predicting the negativity of user comments, this is useful because the app will reliably tell you the negativity ranking of another user without actually skimming through every comment  and interpreting from there


A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

What feedback have you gotten from potential users?


Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?


Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
